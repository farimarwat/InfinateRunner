Unity 3d infinate/endless runner game. This is the basic template and you can start your own game using this initial commit. So fork, start and modify according to your need. I will only work and push when ever I get free time.


### Note: This is an open-source project and only those who super love coding, can join. InfinateRunner is still in development and only 30% is completed. All assets are available  in EnvAssets folder. We have to take it to the next level.
