Unity 3d infinate/endless runner game is super customizable and easy to replace your assets. Documentation will be available soon.
This is the basic template and you can start your own game using this initial commit. So fork, start and modify according to your needs. 
I will only work and push when ever I get free time.


#### Note: This is an open-source project and only those who super love coding, can join. InfinateRunner is still in development and only 30% is completed. All assets are available  in EnvAssets folder. We have to take it to the next level.
